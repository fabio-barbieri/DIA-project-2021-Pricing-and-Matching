---------- TS -----------------
- Beta-Binomial with number of customers that buy / do not buy
- config.py with all global variables
- Env.round() --> returns the number of customers that buy / do not buy ???? (reward in euros computed next)
            --> n bernoulli in order to handle matching ??????
- Consider probabilities of buying / not buying and AT THE END compute the reward in euros (comparison with UCB)
